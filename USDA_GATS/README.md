# Analyzing U.S. Product Exports Using Python and SQL from USDA GATS Data 

This project explores trends in U.S. agricultural exports using data from the USDA Global Agricultural Trade System (GATS). 

It was built as a hands-on data analysis and data engineering portfolio project to practice:

- Accessing and processing data from a real-world API
- Designing and inserting into a MySQL database
- Cleaning and aggregating data for analysis
- Answering real-world questions using SQL and Python
- Communicating insights through code and visualizations

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Motivation 

I chose to complete this project because it would be a great, real world practical exercise in data analysis. It could also directly be applied to my friend's job, which gave me a sort of project coordinator.

## üì¶ Project Structure

- `README.md` ‚Äî you're here!
- `Build Parts/` ‚Äî draft or test versions of scripts and notebooks
- `Finals/` ‚Äî cleaned, working versions of scripts (e.g., API fetch + insert)
- `notebooks/` *(to be created)* ‚Äî where EDA and visualization will happen
- `data/` *(optional)* ‚Äî for storing any CSV exports

## How to Run the Code

THIS IS HOW 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß† Key Questions Explored (Planned)

- How have U.S. exports to major countries changed over time?
- What are the top export products (HS-10 codes) by value?
- Which countries saw the largest increase in export value over 5 years?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîß Skills & Tools

- Python (requests, pandas, etc.)
- SQL (MySQL with upserts and dynamic schema)
- Data cleaning & aggregation
- Data visualization (to come)
- Markdown for documentation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöß Status

‚úÖ API connection + data fetching working  
‚úÖ Database design + insert working  
üîú Data analysis and visualizations in progress  
üîú Final summary report to be added
